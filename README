			       Elizabethan Curses
		     a more interesting Hello World program
		      in every language I'm interested in

When learning Perl in high school, the curse program was the first interesting
code I wrote.  I started with a list of Elizabethan dialect adjectives and
nouns compiled by Jerry Maguire, an English teacher at Center Grove High School
in Greenwood, Indiana.  By combining two adjectives and a noun, you can create
a curse or insult that sounds like it might have been written by William
Shakespeare.

Since that first Perl program, I've implemented the curse program in several
languages as a way to exercise several important features:
  * literal initialization
  * arrays
  * string manipulation
  * functions
  * looping
  * input/output
  * command-line arguments
  * random number generation
  * objects/classes (for languages that deem themselves object-oriented)

Since these implementations are essentially more advanced "hello world"
programs, all code is made available under the public domain, free for any use
which the reader deems helpful.  Since curse was often the first program I
wrote in a particular language, I make no claim of quality.  Suggestions for
improving implementations or making them more idiomatic are welcome,
thou peevish ill-composed hedgepig!
